Unofficial Hacker News API: http://hndroidapi.appspot.com

The API is currently in beta and was developed for the Hacker News Droid app. The API is built in Python and hosted on AppEngine. I used the Beautiful Soup library for HTML parsing/scraping. 

There's five minute caching for main content entry points (/news, /best, /ask, /newest); there's no caching for paginated content (requests that require pageID). 

For any questions, source code, etc, please drop me a note. Cheers, Gleb
